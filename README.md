# odin-recipes
Repo for the Odin Project assignment!
The project I set out to complete was to create a simple html website for three recipes. This was meant to help me learn the basics of html. While creating my website I practiced the html boiler plate 4 times, created links between pages, and added images to 3 pages. I also got more practice using git and Github.
