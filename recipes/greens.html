    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds collard greens, stems removed and leaves chopped</li>
        <li>2 smoked ham hocks</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Hot sauce (optional, for added heat)</li>
    </ul>  
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, place the smoked ham hocks, chopped onion, and minced garlic. Add enough water to cover the ham hocks.</li>
        <li>Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for about 2 hours or until the ham hocks are tender and the meat is falling off the bone.</li>
        <li>Remove the ham hocks from the pot and let them cool slightly. Shred the meat and discard the bones and excess fat.</li>
        <li>Return the shredded meat to the pot. Add the collard greens, chicken broth, apple cider vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper. If you like it spicy, add a few dashes of hot sauce.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the collard greens are tender and flavorful. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.</li>
    </ol>
