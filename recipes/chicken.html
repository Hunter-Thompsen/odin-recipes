    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces (such as thighs and drumsticks)</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the buttermilk and hot sauce. Add the chicken pieces, ensuring they are fully coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight for the best results.</li>
        <li>In a shallow dish, combine the flour, salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven to 350째F (175째C).</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the buttermilk mixture and allow any excess to drip off.</li>
        <li>Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour mixture, pressing the flour onto the chicken to ensure a good coating.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the chicken in the hot oil, skin-side down. Fry for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).</li>
        <li>Remove the fried chicken and place it on a wire rack to drain excess oil. Allow it to cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
