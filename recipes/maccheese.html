    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Cajun mac and cheese is a delicious twist on the classic macaroni and cheese dish, adding a spicy and flavorful kick to the creamy pasta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces elbow macaroni or pasta of your choice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced celery</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning (adjust to taste for spice level)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup breadcrumbs (optional, for topping)</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cook the elbow macaroni or your chosen pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the Cajun seasoning. Adjust the amount to your preferred level of spiciness.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the diced onion, green bell pepper, and celery. Sauté for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic and Cajun seasoning. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the flour over the sautéed vegetables and stir well to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Cook and stir until the mixture thickens, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the shredded cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses. Stir until the cheeses are completely melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir to coat the pasta evenly with the creamy cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>If you want a baked crust on top, transfer the mac and cheese to a greased baking dish, sprinkle with breadcrumbs, and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve your Cajun mac and cheese hot, and enjoy the spicy, cheesy goodness!</li>
    </ol>
